# run.lua
An easy way to run a lua file. Fairly simple batch file, nothing special.

## How to use

Place the bat file in the root directory of your project.

Modify the `LUA_EXE` and `TARGET_FILE` variables in the batch file to fit your requirements, then run it.\
The script will automatically pause when it's finished.
